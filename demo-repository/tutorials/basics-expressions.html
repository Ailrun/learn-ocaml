  <h1>Simple Expressions</h1>
  <h2>Simple Expressions</h2>
  <p>Numerical expressions are easy to compute in OCaml. For example:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    1+2
  </pre>
  <p>Strings are also easy to define. For example, you can define a string
    with your name:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    "Mary"
  </pre>
  <p>The basic element of a string is a char:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    'a'
  </pre>
  <h2>Lists and arrays</h2>
  <p>Lists and arrays are predefined data structures, for example you can
    have a list of integers:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    [ 42; 1; 55 ]
  </pre>
  <p>An array of strings:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    [|"John"; "Doe"|]
  </pre>
  <h2>Operations on lists</h2>
  <p>You can use some predefined functions on lists such as reversing the
    list</p>
  <pre data-run>
    List.rev [1; 2; 3]
  </pre>
  <p>Get the first element of the list:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    List.hd [1; 2; 3]
  </pre>
  <h2>Operations on arrays</h2>
  <p>You can also use some predefined functions on arrays such as concatenate
    two arrays</p>
  <pre data-run>
    Array.append [| 1; 2 |] [| 3; 4; 5 |]
  </pre>
  <p>To get the element number <code>i</code> of an array, you have two ways
    to do this (don't forget, the first element has number <code>0</code> ):</p>
  <pre data-run>
    Array.get [| 42; 51; 32 |] 2
  </pre>
  <p>or</p>
  <pre data-run>
    [| 42; 51; 32 |].(2)
  </pre>
  <h2>Basic operations on strings</h2>
  <p>Strings are sequences of chars. It is possible to create a string from
    just one char, using:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    String.make 10 'x'
  </pre>
  <p>Strings can also be created by joining other strings:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    "Mary" ^ " and " ^ "John"
  </pre>
  <p>It might also be interesting to get the length of a string:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    String.length "abcdefghijklmnopqstuvwxyz"
  </pre>
  <p>(and yes, one character is missing !)</p>
  <h2>More operations on strings</h2>
  <p>There are many operations available on strings, like a function which
    returns a copy of the argument, with all uppercase letters translated to
    lowercase:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    String.lowercase "MARY"
  </pre>
  <p>Here's a more practical example, generating a filename from components:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    String.concat "/" [""; "usr"; "local"; "bin"]
  </pre>
  <p>Note that the second argument is a list of strings.It is sometimes
    useful to extract an integer from a string. This is easy in OCaml:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    int_of_string "546"
  </pre>
  <h2>Operations on Tuples</h2>
  <p>A tuple consists of values (zero or more), enclosed in parentheses and
    separated by commas. Note that you can have differents types for each
    element, remember</p>
  <pre data-run>
    (42, "John", true)
  </pre>
  <p>When you have a pair (a tuple with two elements), you can use some
    predefined functions like get the first element:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    fst (42, "John")
  </pre>
  <p>Or the second element:</p>
  <pre data-run>
    snd (42, "John")
  </pre></body>
